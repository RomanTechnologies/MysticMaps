# Mystic Maps

An interactive application for generating and collaborating on mystical, fantasy maps.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories:

-
 `src`: Contains the Clojure source code.

-
 `resources`: Static assets like images or external data files.

- `test`: Unit tests for the application.
- Dockerfile: For containerization and easy deployment.

## Initializing the Project

The project will be initialized using the Clojure Cli tools. We'll set up necessary dependencies and configure the environment for development.

## Developing Core Functionalities

The main focus will be on implementing the map generation logic, real-time collaboration feature, and API integration.
